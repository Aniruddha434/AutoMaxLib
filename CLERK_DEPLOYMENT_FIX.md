# Clerk Deployment Issue Fix

## Problem
Your application is failing to load Clerk with the error:
```
GET https://clerk.automaxlib.online/npm/@clerk/clerk-js@4/dist/clerk.browser.js net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
```

## Root Cause
The Clerk publishable key `pk_live_Y2xlcmsuYXV0b21heGxpYi5vbmxpbmUk` is configured to use a custom domain `automaxlib.online` that doesn't exist or isn't properly configured.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Get Correct Clerk Production Keys
1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Select your production application
3. Go to **API Keys** section
4. Copy the correct production keys:
   - **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
   - **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_live_`)
   - **Webhook Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

#### Frontend Environment
Update your deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify) environment variables:
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_KEY
```

#### Backend Environment  
Update your backend deployment platform environment variables:
```env
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_SECRET_KEY
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_KEY
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_ACTUAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### Step 3: Verify Domain Configuration

#### Option A: Use Standard Clerk Domain (Recommended)
- Use the standard Clerk keys that point to `clerk.com` domain
- This is the easiest and most reliable option

#### Option B: Configure Custom Domain (Advanced)
If you want to use `automaxlib.online`:
1. In Clerk Dashboard â†’ **Domains**
2. Add custom domain: `clerk.automaxlib.online`
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning
5. Update your keys to use the custom domain

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. Update environment variables on your deployment platform
2. Trigger a new deployment
3. Clear browser cache and test

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
1. Clerk loads without errors
2. Sign-in/sign-up works
3. Authentication state persists
4. API calls include proper auth tokens

## Common Issues

### Issue: Keys still pointing to wrong domain
**Solution**: Double-check you're using the correct environment (production vs development) keys

### Issue: Environment variables not updating
**Solution**: 
- Restart your deployment
- Clear build cache
- Verify variables are set correctly in deployment platform

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**: Ensure your frontend domain is added to Clerk's allowed origins

## Verification Commands

Test your Clerk configuration:
```bash
# Check if Clerk domain resolves
nslookup clerk.automaxlib.online

# Test API endpoint
curl -I https://your-backend-domain.com/api/health
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix the Clerk keys as described above
2. Test authentication flow
3. Monitor for any remaining errors
4. Consider setting up proper monitoring/alerting
