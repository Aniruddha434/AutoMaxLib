## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Diagnostic Tools
- **`fix-clerk-webhook-production.js`** - Comprehensive diagnostic script
- **`verify-webhook-fix.js`** - Simple verification script
- **`PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_FIX_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step fix guide

### 2. Updated Configuration
- Fixed placeholder webhook secret in `backend/.env.production`
- Added clear instructions for getting the correct secret from Clerk Dashboard
- Updated troubleshooting documentation

### 3. Enhanced Documentation
- Updated `CLERK_WEBHOOK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with production-specific steps
- Added Render.com deployment instructions
- Created comprehensive fix guide

## üîß What You Need to Do

### Immediate Action Required:
